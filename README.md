This is a weather app created for the user to input their location and recieve real time weather updates.

This is built using the Open Weather API [https://openweathermap.org/api] (https://openweathermap.org/api)

In order to receive back weather reports when the user inputs a location, we make use of direct geocoding.
Direct geocoding converts the specified name of a location or zip/post code into the exact geographical coordinate.
